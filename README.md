# popclip-openAI

Send selected text to **any supported model and service provider** with any prompt you want.

Want to simply use it?
Just download ChatGPTCustom.popclipextz, double-click it, input your OpenAI key, prompt, model name and provide base_url, then that's it!

The responding message will be written to **system clipboard**, due to the software restriction the pop-up window can't break long line, so this is a walk-around.
